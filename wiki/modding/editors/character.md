# Creating the character with the Character Editor (for real actually)

Creating characters though the engine is now possble, so no more manually creating a XML character file. (yippie!!!)
All you really need is a sprtiesheet and XML file for animation data and they should be placed in ``yourmodfolder/images/characters``
after that, you go to the Character Editor and select "New Character"

After that you should be seeing this following screen:

(insert screenshot here)

Name your character and click the button below "Character Image File" and find the spritesheet that you want to use in ``yourmodfolder/images/characters``
The window will pop up after you press save and close that says "Following files exist" either press "Overide files" or "Use esisting file" (I probably might be doing this process wrong the whole time. if I did then pls let me know) they dont really do anything as far I'm aware.
Your character with a face icon should appear after you press one of the buttons

# Using the ACTUAL Character Editor

When you successfully created the character in the ACTUAL character editor
select your created charater with a face icon and it should take you to this following screen:

(insert screenshot here)
