# Creating the character with the Character Editor (for real)

Creating characters though the engine is now possble, so no more manually creating a XML character file. (yippie!!!)
All you need is a sprtiesheet and XML file for animation data and they should be placed in ``yourmodfolder/images/characters``
after that, you go to the Character Editor and select "New Character"

After that you should be seeing this screenshot below:

(insert the screenshot of create new character screen.png here. and where the FUCK do I put the images)

Name your character and click the button below "Character Image File" and find the spritesheet that you want to use in ``yourmodfolder/images/characters``
The window will pop up after you press save and close that says "Following files exist" either press "Overide files" or "Use esisting file" (I probably might be doing this process wrong the whole time. if I did then pls let me know) they dont really do anything as far I'm aware.
Your character with a face icon should appear after you press one of the buttons.

# Using the ACTUAL Character Editor

When you successfully created the character in the ACTUAL character editor
select your created charater with a face icon and it should take you to this screenshot below:

(insert the screenshot of character editor.png here. how the FUCK do I put the images in here)

I'm using this dumb sprite example (I hope the devs are ok with this.)

The idle, poses and any other animations the from xml gets filled in automatically. But you're not done yet, there's still some other stuff that you have to do in the character editor.
Like using the menu on the right side of the screen. But we'll foucus on that for this page.

(insert the screenshot of more character editor stuff.png)

Let's quickly explain what the little buttons do on 

  - Ghost icon = It creates the transparent frame from the animation
  - Pencil icon = Extends the animation window
  - Trash can icon = Deletes the animation
